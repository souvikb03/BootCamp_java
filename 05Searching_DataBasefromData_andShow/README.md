# Searching Data from Database And Show
#
#
### Using java program and taking input from the user , students details can be searched that already uploaded to Database.
### Here the backend Java code is linked to the database.
### Tools Required for project -> 1.Netbeans ; 2.Using XAMPP as the Database!
### In the first image we have created a jsp file in a new project named 'ProjectEx2', for that right click on ProjectEx2 then following window opens go to 'New' then select 'Jsp'.

#
### In this image we can see that the jsp file has been cretaed. in Jsp file we can write html and java code simultaneously by using scriptlet represented by the symbol '<%' whenever we need to write java code we can simply write this and start writing java code in html code. Then write the frontcode code using html where can enter the details we want to search.

### After Successfully running the code we can enter a particular details of the registration class table if that data  exists on the database then it will show all rest details of that table. For ex in this image we enter a particular email then click on the 'search now' button.

### Since that email does not exist on the database hence it will show the message 'No Such Data' as shown in the image below.

### In this way, we saw how the searching of data from a database is done, and how the backend is connected to the frontend (console).The frontend of any website is actually used to take user input. The frontend and the backend are connected
